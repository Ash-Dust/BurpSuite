Continuing from the previous lab, this time we will use Burp's Repeater to send request and to see the response from the server over and over again.

Each time we visit a product, the browser will send the GET method with the productID parameter.

# Send the request to Burp Repeater

Right-click on any of the requests and choose send to Repeater.

Then go to Repeater tab > click Send to see the response of the server.

We can try send as much as we want to study about the site.
Here we can see that the browser always deliver a parameter called ProductID which is an int. what if we change it to string?

We can see that at the end of the page there is "Apache Struts: 2 2.3.31"
Which mean we can get the framework and the version of it. This can be a useful information for adversaries.
